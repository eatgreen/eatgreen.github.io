## Stage


### Context

In the field of fluid dynamics research and application, reconstructing the 3D flow through imaging particles driven by the flow, followed by inferring spatiotemporal flow features from particle images, is an important method to investigate the small scale flow phenomena related to the turbulance. The state-of-the-art methods include TomoPIV, STB and VIC+. Currently we are investigating new approach able to better address this problem. The proposed method, with its core algorithm (tracking and optimization) already implemented in C++, has outperformed other methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness.  

This internship will be carried out in team ACTA/OPAALE at Irstea Rennes center. This internship will participate in the coding work of several important modules contributing to the existing code framework. Those modules include the one for particle finding in single view and the one for stereoscopic matching traversing multiple views.

### Object

First, the intern is expected to get familiar with the stereoscopic reconstruction problem, and to understand our approach as well as other state-of-the-art methods. Then, the intern will implement the necessary modules in complementary to the existing code to promote our implementations to industry level able to compete with other commercial softwares. Last, the intern will participate in experiment set-up, results analysis as well as publication.

### Candidate

The candidate is expected to know well in computer vision, possibly with experience of OpenCV. A good knowledge on fluid dynamics is also preferred. Coding skill is required, preferably in C++. Knowledge on machine learning is a plus.
