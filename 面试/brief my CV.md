##mon compétence 

1. machine learning with application on nonlinear model and optimization, image sequence processing.

2. practical knowledge on HPC, MPI.

3. operational code management, understanding other's work and able to modify and integrate new algorithm. je maîtrisez les langages de programmation C/C++ et êtes sensibilisé aux règles de codage communément admises, ainsi que les principaux outils de développements.

I had a master degree in ecole centrale nantes, specialized in applied mechnics, then I did my phD in Rennes Inria, majored in signal processing.

Before my phd, I am working in the field of CFD (mecanique des fluides numérique). My first experience important is the internship that I did in ifremer in which I am in charge of developing open boundary conditions for ocean dynammics. The proposed scheme works as expected and allows a better exchange of information through the interface as well as stablizing the numerical schemes. 

After that, I changed a bit my trajectory. Since my PhD until my recent work at cerfacs, I work in the context of bayesian filtering based on non-linear dynamic model in using the statistic learnig algorithm to process the temporal correlated image data. I did two projects during my thesis which yield two papers published in international journals. In the first project, I work with my colleagues on reconstructing the free surface flow from the image data, both the gray scale data in which we use the optical flow technique to deduce the dense motion (the problem is the velocity may not be valid if constant luminance hypothesis is not valid) or use the implicit formulation to matching correspondant velocity fields as well as the depth sensor data which measures the distance from the camera to the objects. By introducing those observed velocity and height, we are able to reconstruct 3d fluid flow by correcting the prevision made by the unperfect model. Especialy I contrubute to a new filtering method provides a smoothing for the dynamics. The second project centers on proposing a parameterized model for the discrepency between large scale numerical simualation and small scale observation. By intergrating similar learning algorithm above, we can deduce the best estimation for the parameter which minimizes the scale discrepancy. In particularly, we tried to tracking a closed contour by using level set method in order to best interpreting the physcial meaning of certain image. 

The work I am done at cerfacs is mostly concentrated on developing new algorithms for an operational oceanographe model used in meteo france and ecmwf. Basically I am incharge of developing an incertainty propagation scheme in the context of monte-carlo technique. The work hightlights the implentation of efficient optimization method under hpc structure using MPI. Besides, all the work I realized requires a deep notion in coding especially under operational context. Understanding other's work and able to modify and integrate new algorithm. I mastered the languages as C++, fortran and I am quite sensible to the coding rule prescribed by the standards. Also I am quite familiar with the development tools.
