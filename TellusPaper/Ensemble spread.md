In the orginal article, the ensemble spread is said to be constant with stochastic model and reduces with standard model. 

However, after some recalculation, 
1. both for stochastic model and standard model, the ensemble spread decreases along assimilation windows. 
2. the first cycle, due to the arbitrary error statistics associated with the sigma, the ensemble spread is quite large. This ensemble spread corresponds to the error of the background, it is large so that the correctio is important. 
3. we see for stochastic model, the spread decreases slowly along windows while for standard model, the spread from the third window is barely seen.
