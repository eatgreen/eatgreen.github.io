##Ax=b
the linear system is consistent if having one or infinite solution
the product of Ax can be seen as a linear combination of colunms of A with weight in x
1. matrix vector product
2. vector equation
3. linear equation with augmented matrix

##Ax=0
homegeneous
pivot position
free variable

linear independent, only zero solution
linear dependent, non-zero solution

###A theorem stating that for an indexed set $(v_1, ..., v_p)$, two or more vector is linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors is a linear combination of others.

proof, if $v_p=a_1v_1+...+a_{p-1}v_{p-1}$ suggesting that $a_1v_1+...+a_{p-1}v_{p-1}-v_p=0$, then $Va=0$ has a non-zero solution, suggesting that vectors are linear dependent.

##linear combination point of view
range: the set of image of x. if c is in the range of T is a way of saying Ax=c is consistent
