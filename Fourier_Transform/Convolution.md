###Definition
\[(g*h)(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(t-x)f(x)dx.
\]

**Convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain.2**

**Multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain.**

###Smmothing and averaging
g is used to smooth f in g*f.

Computing any value of (g * f)(t) involves all of the values of g and all of the values of f, and adding the products of corresponding values of g and f with one of the functions flipped and dragged.
