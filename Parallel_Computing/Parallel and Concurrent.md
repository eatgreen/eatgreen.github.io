Parallel: use parallel hardware to run computation more quickly. Efficiency is the concern
* subproblem
* optimal use of parallel hardware

Concurrent: may or may not run multiple exe at the same time. 
* when can an exe start
* how can information exchange occur
* how to manage access to shared resources
* convenience.

Granularity levels
* bit-level parallelism
* instruction-level
* task-level, separate instruction

Hardware
* multi-core processors
* graphic processing unit
* field-programmable gate arrays FPGA
* computer clusters
