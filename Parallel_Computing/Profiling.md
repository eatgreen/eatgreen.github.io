Profiling determines where a program spends its time. It detects the computationally intensive parts of the code.

Use profiling when you want to focus attention and optimization efforts on those loops that are responsible for the bulk of the computational load.

Most codes follow the 90-10 Rule. That is, 90% of the computation is done in 10% of the code.
