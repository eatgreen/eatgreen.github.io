#Cache conceptes

CPU time = clock cycles on instrctions + clock cycles waiting for memory

##Memory Hierarchy

fast memory close to CPU, slower memory further away from CPU.

* Register
   Registers are the sources and destinations of CPU data operations. They hold one data element and are 32 bits or 64 bits wide. They are on-chip and built from SRAM.
* Cache line
   
* Cache Hit occurs when the data element requested by the processor is in the cache. The Cache Hit Rate is defined as the fraction of cache hits.

* Cache miss
* Levels of Cache
* Memory Hierarchy Sizes
      Memory hierarchy sizes are specified in the following units:
      Cache Line: bytes
      L1 Cache: Kbytes
      L2 Cache: Mbytes
      Main Memory: Gbytes

##Cache Mapping
* direct mapped cache
* set associative cache
* fully associative cache

##Cache thrashing
##Cache coherence
