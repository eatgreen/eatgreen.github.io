Spatial distribution of ensemble perturbation increments: 
-- For the 1st ensemble member, the increments should be bounded by the region of observation.

Spatial distribution of variance reduction:
-- Variance is decreasing around the observation region
-- D-evil is more averagely spread compared to R-evil.

Correlation :
-- Correlation with respect to certain points on the grids.
-- R-evil produces localized correlation fields because it uses the square root of B rather than the prior ensemble fields.
-- D-evil, localization did not change the posterior correlation.
