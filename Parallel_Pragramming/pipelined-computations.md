###Pipeline technique
####A problem can be divided into a series of sequential tasks.
1. if more than one instance of the completed problem is to be executed.
2. if a series of data items must be processed, each requiring multiple operations.
3. if information to start the next process can be passed forward before the process has completed all its internal operations.

#####Type 1 pipeline.
add number, each processor recv the sum, add then send the new sum to next processor.

#####Type 2 pipeline.

#####Type 3 pipeline. only one instances.
solving linear system, upper triangular form.
