##Fisrst one
1. ###object initilization
2. ###apperance modelling
3. ###motion estimation: linear regression, kalman filter and particle filter
4. ###object localization

contour tracking
###visual representations
* global: 
   * optical flow representation. 
   * active coutours         

* local: 

##Second one
###feature selection for tracking
* optical flow, egde, color, texture

###object detection
* segmentation, partition image into perceptually similar regions
   * active coutours
      * implicit level set
* supervised learning
   * adaptive boosting: 
   * svm

###object tracking
* follow the trajectory of an object.
   * contour tracking
      * state space model
         object's state defined in terms of the shape and the motion parameter of the contour.
      * variational methods
         minimizing coutour energy functinal
